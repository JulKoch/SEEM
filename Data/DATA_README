Two datasets are available as example data:
One year of (1) daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps and (2) daily land-surface-temperature (LST) maps simulated at the Skjern catchment. 
The Skjern catchment is located in western Denmark and amounts to ~2500 km2. The catchment has been investigated by the HOBE project 
since 2007 (www.hobe.dk).

The datasets originate from a process-based, distributed hydrological model (MIKESHE), coupled to a land-surface model (SW-ET).

The dimensions of the files are as follows: 60 rows, 72 columns, 365 days, 3 scenarios with a spatial resolution of 1km2. The first 
scenario is the baseline model and is considered as reference model in the following examples. The second scenario is based on a 
reduced spatial detail in vegetation parametrization and the third scenario is based on a reduced spatial detail in climatic forcing. 
Originally these data were simulated for a sensitivity analysis of the catchment model. This is not of concern of this repository, where 
the data will simply serve as an example dataset.
