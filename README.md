## Spatial Evaluation of Environmental Models
***
Keywords: 
- Spatial Patterns
- Model Evaluation
- Remote Sensing
- Spatial Statistics

***
This repository contains methodologies that can be incorporated as spatial performance metrics to evaluate spatial model output. Simulated patterns are compared with reference patterns (e.g. remote sensing observations) and the spatial performance is quantified by a skill score.

The EOF example is up and running. Documentation will be added. In the meantime please check Koch et al.(2015) in the documentation folder 
for reference.  

## Work in progress!!
