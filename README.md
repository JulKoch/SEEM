Spatial Evaluation of Environmental Models

This repository contains methodologies that can be incorporated as spatial performance metrics to evaluate spatial model out.  Simulated patterns are compared against reference patterns (e.g. a remote sensing observation) and the spatial performance is quantified by a skill score.
