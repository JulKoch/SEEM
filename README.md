***
This repository contains methodologies that can be incorporated as spatial performance metrics to evaluate spatial model output. Simulated patterns are compared with reference patterns (e.g. remote sensing observations) and the spatial performance is quantified by a skill score.

The EOF example is up and running. Detailed documentation will be added. In the meantime please check Koch et al. (2015) in the documentation folder for reference.

The Connectivity analysis example is up and running. Detailed documentation will be added. The first example focus on the illustration of the methodology where the connectivity analysis is applied on a single map comparison. The second example applies the connectivity analysis on a series of maps and gives a similarity score for each timestep. Here the connectivity is assessed individually for the high and the low phase. In the meantime please check Koch et al. (2016) in the documentation folder for reference.
 

## Work in progress!!
