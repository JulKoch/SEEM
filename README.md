Spatial Evaluation of Environmental Models

This repository contains methodologies that can be incorporated as spatial performance metrics to evaluate spatial model output. Simulated patterns are compared with reference patterns (e.g. remote sensing observations) and the spatial performance is quantified by a skill score.
